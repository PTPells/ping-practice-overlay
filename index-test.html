            Certain ideas sing. They resonate in our bodies, touch some
            invisible place within.
          </div>

          <p>
            Sometimes we encounter these ideas out in the world. Other times, we
            hear them in our minds. Sometimes they are language, other times
            feelings or thoughts. Whatever they are — they’re meaningful energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Ping Practice universe, we call these resonances “Pings”.
            <sup>1234</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            What – if anything – these “Pings” might mean and how we might use
            them is rarely clear in the moment. Their meaning often unfolds and
            evolves over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fleeting nature of these Pings, and the uncertainty of their
            significance, can make deciding if and where to hold them (and how
            to work with them) unclear.
          </p>
          <p>Ping Practice emerged precisely from this place.</p>
          <p>
            Ping Practice is a journaling
            <a href="#method" class="method-link">method</a> and
            <a href="#app" class="app-link">app</a> designed to help you
            synthesize these fleeting bits of resonance into wisdom you are
            inspired and equipped to embody.
          </p>
          <p>
            The method emerged through years of experimentation orbiting a
            central question:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >How might I locate what I learn and experience in ways that equip
              me to apply them in the fleeting moments when I sense
              opportunities to do so?</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Ping Practices continues to be shaped by an expansive body of
            pre-existing thought and through conversations with
            <a href="people.html">people</a> who see making-meaning from what
            they experience as an act of survival.
          </p>
